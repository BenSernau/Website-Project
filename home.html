					About
				</h1>
				<p>
					I’ve always enjoyed stories, whether they’re in games, novels, or movies.  I spent most of my teenage years writing mediocre vignettes, but I wasn’t sure I enjoyed reading enough to become a good writer, so I tried programming.  Attempting to be a novelist, I was dancing around the fact that all I wanted to do in life was make video games, so I finished school with a degree in computer science instead of writing.  I seek currently to expand my skills, and I’m going to teach myself a little more extensively about JavaScript frameworks, SQL, PHP, and C++.  While writing may very well come back into my life, for now, there’s plenty to learn about programming.  Thank you for stopping by.
